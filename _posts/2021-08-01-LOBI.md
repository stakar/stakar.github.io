LOBI
======

Last week I started internship at Laboratory of Brain Imaging at Nencki Institute, I am learning how to conduct MRI experiments.

This is great time, I spent last days working on analysis script to get timing of stimuli from Presentations logs, so there is easy, automated way of sdoing that and so making analysis less time-consuming. Probably I am blabering, because I am so excited.

After work I have time to read and write, which is **awesome**. Still, I miss my wife and dog. I call her (wife) every day, but it is still hard.

Next week I will be shadowing multiple experiments, that involve both blind subjects and sighted controls. They will be performing N-Back task, with tactile words presentation, i.e. in braille. I check the script for control of special bound that allows for presentation of this stimuli, that was really something.
