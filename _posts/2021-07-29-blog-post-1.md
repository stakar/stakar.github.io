So, basically I started using github pages, because I want to have my own space at the Internet. Right now I am sitting in a train, going to Pozna≈Ñ from Warsaw. Doing shitload of things, reading book about psychology of activism, trying write novel, playing with this page and MRI data, that I have downloaded from openneuro, to work on MRI data analysis.
