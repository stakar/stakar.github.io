I applied for internship and got to recruitment process.
I received 1-page-long document with various tasks, to show my skills with data analytics.

Couple first ones was with logical thinking and setting up directory, which was fun.
Then, couple harder showed up, including one with xpath, which I have never used before,
but I managed to prepare nice solution. I had to remember a bit SQL, which I have used
only for learning purposes in 3rd year of cognitive science.

Last task was with numpy and pandas, those were enjoyable. I managed to provide solution for
each one, and I even turn numpy solution from functions to class (I've read that they require
objective programming, so I thought it would be nice touch).

It all was fruitfull process, for I received invitation for interview, which was quite hard.
I managed to answer for most of the questions, even for ones I didn't know the answer to.

We will see, maybe I'll got to be data science dev intern? It would me **amazing**.
