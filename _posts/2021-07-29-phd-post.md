PHD
======

I am doing PHD in psychology at Doctorate School of Social Sciences and Humanities. My dissertation is about imagery techniques, it's neural basis and a way of analysing that.

In my procedure I am going to use Multivoxel Pattern Analysis, however I have to go deep on this subject, because there may be some problem with experiment setup to do so. But I hope I will manage to get to that.
