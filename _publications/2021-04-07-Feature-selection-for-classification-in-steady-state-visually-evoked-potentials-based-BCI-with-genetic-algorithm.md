This paper is about research on Brain-Computer Interfaces,  utilizing SSVEP phenomena. It is based on [Bakardjian's BCI](https://www.biosemi.com/publications/pdf/Bakardjian_2010_Optimization_SSVEP-BCI.pdf) system, however it is extended by features extraction module [Abootalebi et al. (2009)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19041154/). I developed genetic algorithm that connects all modules and reduce dimensions to maximize accuracy, time performance and ITR (Inforamtion Transfer Ratio).
